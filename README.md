# LinFun-ImmersiveForest

This is the repository for the LinFun demo app Immersive Forest made for the Nasa Space Apps Challenge Hackathon April 22-24th 2016.
The app will work on Android devices.
Through the Google Cardboad, it shows a virtual forest where the gaze will follow the user's head direction. 

Our other demo app, twister in space, has a repository at https://github.com/Splikk/LinFun-SpaceTwister.
